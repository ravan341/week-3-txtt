# Calculator

## Description
A colaborative project with 2 member, where we build a simple calculator which does addition, subtraction, division and multiplication

## Steps

### Building Files
1) add_sub.py: which has addition and subtraction function code
2) mul-div.py: which has multiplication and division function code

### Git & Other Commands used in Command Prompt
1) `mkdir <file_name>` to create the folder
2) `cd <file name>` to go inside the folder
3) `git init`, initializing folder as git repository
4) manually add all the files
5) `git add .` to add all the files into git track
6) `git commit -m "<message>"`, it commits whatever is there in the track
7) `git remote add origin <GitHub repository link>`, builds connection between git and github
8) `git push --set-upstream origin master`, sends all the files from git to github.
9) `git pull` to pull the files which were uploaded by my team member to github
